This is an example program to test the AZ-Touch.

## Get started
So you just got your AZ-Touch case, soldered the parts, installed the screen and ESP32 and want to test the hardware and start your first project? 

No problem - this little program is meant to make you life easier. Just load it into Visual Studio Code and let PlatformIO do its magic. Test your hardware and start coding.

A step by step guide and more functions will be added over time.
